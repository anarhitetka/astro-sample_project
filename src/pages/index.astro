////////////////////////////////////////////

  Astro runs any JavaScript written in a component’s frontmatter at build-time;

  Optionally, Astro can send JavaScript to the browser to allow client-side interactivity;
  (The client-side JavaScript will be sent to a user’s browser when it is written or imported in <script> tags)
  
////////////////////////////////////////////

You had previously used some JavaScript to build parts of your site:

    Defining your page title and heading dynamically
    Mapping through a list of skills on the About page
    Conditionally displaying HTML elements

Those commands are all executed at build time to create static HTML for your site, and then the code is “thrown away.”

The JavaScript in a <script> tag is sent to the browser, and is available to run, based on user interactions like refreshing a page or toggling an input.
