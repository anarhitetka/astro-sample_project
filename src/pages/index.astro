<!-- 
  The button won't work without the client:laod directive.

  The button works because the client:load directive tells Astro to send and rerun its JavaScript to the client when the page loads, making the component interactive. 
  We call this a hydrated component. 

  ------------------

  other directives:
  client:load
  client: visible (sends the component's JavaScript when it's visible on the page)

  -------------------

  Difference between components with and without client:load directive:
  
  Same: They both show the same HTML elements and look the same initially. (only HTML and CSS are sent)
  
  Different: The component with the client:load directive will rerender after the page is loaded, and any interactive elements that it has will work.
  (HTML, CSS and JavaScript sent)
